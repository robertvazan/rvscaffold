# Robert Važan's Project Scaffolding

This repository contains guidelines for Large Language Models (LLMs) to enforce standard project structure in Robert Važan's projects. It is a successor to a Python-based scaffolding tool, shifting from rigid automation to flexible, AI-powered assistance.

These guidelines are primarily intended for LLMs, but they are written in plain language to be understandable by humans as well.

## Usage

To apply these guidelines to a project, instruct your LLM assistant to consult this repository, starting with the main [guidelines document](guidelines/README.md).

The LLM can adapt the guidelines to project-specific requirements. Any exceptions or special instructions for a particular project should be documented in that project's `CONTRIBUTING.md` file or a similar document.

## Structure

This repository is organized as follows:

-   `guidelines/`: The core content. It contains a main [`README.md`](guidelines/README.md) that serves as an entry point, with language-specific guidelines in subdirectories (e.g., `java/`, `dotnet/`).
-   `legacy/`: The old Python-based scaffolding code, preserved for historical reference.
-   `CONTRIBUTING.md`: Meta-guidelines for maintaining this repository, which you are currently reading.
-   `README.md`: Introduction, usage, basic information.
