# Robert Važan's Project Scaffolding

This is project scaffolding tool somewhat similar to [pyscaffold](https://pyscaffold.org/en/stable/),
but it supports a range of programming languages and it implements Robert Važan's personal conventions and policies.
It can be executed repeatedly to keep generated files up to date.

If you come across one of my repositories that have project files generated by this tool,
just edit the generated files by hand like you would in any other project
and I will update scaffolding configuration in repository's `scripts/configure.py` after merge.

## Usage

The following are notes to myself.
To use this tool, create `scripts/configure.py` in the repository that looks like this:

```python
import rvscaffold as scaffold

class Project(scaffold.Java):
    def script_path_text(self): return __file__
    def repository_name(self): return 'sourceafis-java'
    def pretty_name(self): return 'SourceAFIS for Java'
    def pom_name(self): return 'SourceAFIS'

    def dependencies(self):
        yield from super().dependencies()
        yield self.use('com.machinezoo.fingerprintio:fingerprintio:1.3.0')
        yield self.use_fastutil()
        yield self.use_commons_io()

Project().generate()
```

See real examples for supported languages:

- Java: [sourceafis-java](https://github.com/robertvazan/sourceafis-java/blob/master/scripts/configure.py)
- NET: [sourceafis-net](https://github.com/robertvazan/sourceafis-net/blob/master/scripts/configure.py)

There are lots of options for all supported languages. See source code of this tool.
In addition to options specified in `configure.py`,
there should be a standalone file `scripts/version.txt` that contains only one line with project version.

To run `configure.py`, make sure that `PYTHONPATH` includes `src` directory in checked out `rvscaffold`.
This tool is not currently available from PyPI.
