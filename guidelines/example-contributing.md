# How to contribute to Example Project

Thank you for taking interest in Example Project. This document provides guidance for contributors.

## Authoritative repository

The authoritative repository is on GitHub: https://github.com/robertvazan/example-project

Please submit all issues and pull requests there.

## Issues

Both bug reports and feature requests are welcome. There is no free support, but it's perfectly reasonable to open issues asking for more documentation or better usability.

## Pull requests

Pull requests are generally welcome. If you would like to make large or controversial changes, please open an issue first to discuss your idea.

Don't worry too much about formatting and naming. Code will be reformatted after merge. Just avoid running your formatter on whole source files, because that makes diffs hard to understand.

## License

Your submissions will be distributed under the project's [Apache License 2.0](LICENSE).
