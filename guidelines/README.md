# Project Guidelines

This document is the main entry point to a set of guidelines for structuring projects. These guidelines are intended to be interpreted by Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist with software development, but they are also human-readable.

## General Files

All projects, regardless of language, should contain some standard files in their root directory. A complete `README.md` example is available [here](example-readme.md).

### `README.md`

The `README.md` file is the front page of the project. It should include:

- A Stand with Ukraine banner.
- The project's short name as a level 1 heading (e.g., "SourceAFIS for Java").
- Badges for build status, package registry versions, and test coverage (if generated by the project).
- A short description of the project.
- A "Status" section describing the project's maturity. Common statuses include:
  - **Experimental:** The project is under active development, and APIs may change.
  - **Stable:** The project is considered stable and suitable for production use.
  - **Obsolete:** The project is no longer maintained.
  - For projects that use [Stagean](https://stagean.machinezoo.com/) annotations, the status description should mention it.
- A "Getting started" or "Documentation" section with links to the project's homepage, API documentation (like Javadoc or XML doc comments), and other relevant resources.
- For open-source projects, "Feedback" and "License" sections pointing to `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `LICENSE` files.

### `LICENSE`

For open-source projects, a `LICENSE` file containing the Apache License 2.0 is required. It should be a copy of the [LICENSE file from this project](../LICENSE).

### `COPYRIGHT`

A `COPYRIGHT` file should be present to state copyright information clearly. It should use the project's long legal name (e.g., "Robert Va≈æan's SourceAFIS for Java"). See the [COPYRIGHT example](example-copyright.txt) for the recommended format.

### `CONTRIBUTING.md`

This file provides guidance for contributors. See the [CONTRIBUTING.md example](example-contributing.md) for a recommended template. It should cover:

- Links to repositories (GitHub, Bitbucket).
- Guidance on how to submit issues and pull requests.
- A statement that contributions will be licensed under the project's license.
- If the project contains generated code, a note about how it is managed. Scripts for code generation are typically placed in the `scripts/` directory.
- Any project-specific exceptions to the guidelines in this repository.

### `.gitignore`

Every project must have a `.gitignore` file. It should start with the contents of the [base .gitignore from this project](../.gitignore), followed by language-specific patterns.

## Language-Specific Guidelines

For detailed instructions on setting up projects in a specific language, see the documents below:

- [Java Project Guidelines](java/README.md)
- [.NET Project Guidelines](dotnet/README.md)
- [Python Project Guidelines](python/README.md)

## Private Projects

These guidelines primarily describe public, open-source projects. Private projects (personal or proprietary) that are not intended for publication follow a simplified structure:

- **`README.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md`**: These files should clearly state that the project is personal and private. The `CONTRIBUTING.md` file in this case is not for external contributors but serves as a reference for the author and for LLM assistants, documenting the project's structure and development conventions.
- **No `LICENSE` or `COPYRIGHT`**: Since the project is not distributed, these files are omitted.
- **Repositories**: Private projects usually do not have a remote repository. `CONTRIBUTING.md` does not list repository links in that case. If a remote repository exists, it is private and used for personal purposes like synchronization, not for public collaboration.
- **No CI/CD**: There are no public continuous integration workflows (e.g., GitHub Actions). Consequently, `README.md` files for private projects do not include build status badges or other CI-related information.
- **Simplified `README.md`**: The `README.md` is simpler and focused on the project's purpose and usage for the author. Sections related to open-source collaboration, like "Feedback" and "License", are omitted. It also omits badges and banners common in public projects.

## Migration from the Old Scaffolding Tool

If you are familiar with the previous Python-based scaffolding tool, please read the [Migration Guide](migration.md) to understand the changes.
