# Migration Guide

This guide is for migration of repositories from the previous Python-based tool to the new LLM-based approach. Apply these guidelines to clean up repositories that still contain `scripts/configure.py` or other remnants of the old system.

## `scripts/configure.py` is Gone

The most significant change is the removal of the `scripts/configure.py` script in target projects. There is no longer a central script to run. Instead, project maintenance is performed by an LLM assistant that has been instructed to follow the guidelines in this repository.

## `scripts/version.txt` is Gone

Projects no longer have a `scripts/version.txt` file. The project version should be managed directly in the build file:
-   For Java projects, this is the `<version>` tag in `pom.xml`.
-   For .NET projects, this is the `<Version>` tag in the `.csproj` file.

## No "Generated by" Headers

Files that were previously generated by the scaffolding tool (like `README.md`, `pom.xml`, `.gitignore`) no longer contain a "Generated by scripts/configure.py" header. All files in a project are meant to be edited directly, either by a human or an LLM.

## No Reusable GitHub Workflows

The `rvscaffold` repository no longer provides reusable GitHub Actions workflows. Each project should have its own complete workflow files (e.g., `build.yml`, `release.yml`) in its `.github/workflows` directory. The guidelines provide templates and principles for what these workflows should do.

## Dependency Management

The scaffolding tool used to provide helper methods to add common dependencies. This is no longer the case. Dependencies should be added and managed manually in the project's build file (`pom.xml` or `.csproj`).
